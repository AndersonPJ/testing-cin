These samples use the Gradle build system. To build a project, enter the project directory and use the ./gradlew assemble command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

Use ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest to run the tests on a connected emulator or device.
Use ./gradlew test to run the unit test on your local host.
There is a top-level build.gradle file if you want to build and test all samples from the root directory. This is mostly helpful to build on a CI (Continuous Integration) server.
